Tubby Middleman
===============

If you love pre-processors, asset managers, and all the beautiful things that come with modern development, you're going to love Middleman. 

This custom flavor comes with Sprockets and bower integrated, and bourbon for beautiful sass mixins. We're also using slim as the erb replacement. 

Tubby Middleman works right out fo the bat with heroku, and uses puma as the server

##To make the app your own

Simply modify your bower.json and gemfile as needed, and start crafting your beautiful website in the source folder
